Would you rather...
In the "Would You Rather?" Project is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

State
For this application, most of the application’s state is managed by Redux - questions, users and authenticated user.  
Internal state is maintained inside each controlled component.

TL;DR
To get started developing right away:
